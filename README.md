# Claw-Code
Code for APSC 101 Module 5 Claw.
Product of team R3.

# Dowloading this code and running it on your Arduino
In the upper right-hand corner, select the green `download code` button. 

1. Select `download zip` and download the zipped file.  

2. Exctract the zipped folder and load the `main.ino` file into the arduino IDE. You can ignore the vscode folder, Eric is just to lazy to put in a proper `.gitignore`.

3. Upload the file to the arduino as you normally would.

# Contributing Code
It's pretty easy!

The simplest way to contribute code to this repo is using the online github editor. Navigate to the `main.ino` file and select the `edit this file` button in the top right (looks like a pencil) and paste in your changes. It's a good idea to make these changes in an IDE on your computer, so that you can verify and test them before uploading them here.

At the bottom, of the page, make sure to select `Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request.` This way we can review everything that gets put in and make sure that the code in the `main` branch is always functional. 

If you want to do it without using the online editor, message Eric on discord and I'll be motivated to explain how - I'm to lazy to do it now.

# Troubleshooting

### The code doesn't compile/there are errors when I try to load it on the arduino
* Make sure the ardino IDE has the right serial port connected
* Otherwise there's probably a bug in the code. Message Eric in the discord becuase it's probably my fault. Make sure to tag me in order to motivate me to get off my arse and fix it.

### The arduino isn't behaving as I expect
* Make sure all the wires are plugged into the right place. The pins that everything should be plugged into are outlines at the top of the `main.ino` file.
* Otherwise the code is probably crap and full of bugs. Message Eric in the discord becuase it's probably my fault. Make sure to tag me in order to motivate me to get off my arse and fix it.
